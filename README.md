- Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, npm, React

- Key features of the code


- Navigation using React - website can be navigated via the Header or the Footer section. A separate component for the navigation is created and is linked to each of the pages in the main application via dynamic routing and the React Router. This allows a seamless navigation between the home page and individual section pages. Furthermore, the URL is configured so that it uses the section name to generate a unique URL based on the title of the page. This allows the user to know which page they are on as well as easily remember the URL link to navigate between pages.

- Users will see the navigation bar at all times when visiting between the pages. The bar layout will also adjust based on the screen size as the user enlarge/reduce the size of the browser or visits the site through a different device (eg. Mobile, tablet). Once the size reaches a certain size minimum, the bar will turn into a hamburger menu for the user to access the bar and makes it more user friendly rather than squeezing everything in one view. 


- Images  - The css was updated in the photo gallery section to allow the photos by setting both height and width to ‘auto’ to adjust based on its original sizes. Because each photo differ in it’s width and height, configuring them to a set number would distort the images that does not match the original size. Additional effects were added to each of the images by giving it a transition where the images enlarge slightly when mouse is hovered over. This shows the user which image is selected and is in focus. 

- Drag & Drop feature - When submitting a Contacts form, users also have the ability to share their work to send along with them form (resume, projects, etc.). The Drag & Drop feature (DragStart, DragOver, DragLeave, etc.) is used here to make it easy for users to simply drop the files into the appropriate section and enhance the usability of the form. Or they have the option to upload the file through the openFileDialog function and selecting the files manually. Once the file is uploaded, users can also remove the file from the upload through the drag feature by clicking on the item and dragging outside of the section. 
 
- Geolocation feature - When users first visit the site, they will see a greeting message noting the city and country of the user’s location. This is achieved by the geolocation function and obtaining the user’s approximate location data from an external API (ipapi). This is an interactive way to make the user feel more engaged and connected when visiting the website. 


- CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid Layout: Each of my file incorporates either a Flexbox or Grid Layout method in its CSS. I used the Flexbox when I had arranged the content of my site in a certain direction (row or column) or the size of the items can be flexible. These files includes the photos, navigation, contact form, biography section. I used the Grid Layout when I had arranged the content of my site in two dimensions and wanted more control of the layout. For example, the home page uses a grid layout as the contents on the page are not in any specific pattern but in specific areas that I had placed them in.
